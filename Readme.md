# PX4 uBlox GNSS Communication Analysis
Extraction of the uBlox GNSS module communication from a PX4 flight log (uLog format) and analysis of the logged raw data communication.

PX4 has the option (`GPS_DUMP_COMM`) to dump the GPS module communication to the flight log.
The standard log analysis tools do not evaluate this information, so a special solution is needed.


## Installation

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
